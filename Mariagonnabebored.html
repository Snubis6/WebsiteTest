    Intro
</h2>
<p>
    Greetings, this article will explain how to understand electronical circuit so that any beginner in electronics can understand.
</p>
<h2>
    Easy explanation
</h2>
<p>
    Most important part is that any electronical circuit requires a power source, without it nothing will function, a power source can be a battery or an outlet in the wall. And after that comes making sure that everything is connected properly, one loose cable and your circuit is not closed anymore and thus nothing will work. Also it is very important not to short circuit by connecting “+” and “–” of power source onto each other without any resistance as this can damage all of your components.

<h2>
    Theoretical part
</h2>
<p>
    Next comes the more boring, theoretical part. First things first let’s imagine that all components except the wires are users of electricity and power source is a contributor. It is important to know about three forces governing any kind of circuit. Voltage (V), current (I, uppercase "i") and resistance (R). Voltage is measured in (<span style="font-weight:900">volts V</span>) current is measured in (<span style="font-weight:900">amps A</span>) and resistance is measured in (<span style="font-weight:900">ohms Ω</span>). 
</p>
<p>
    A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of plumbing pipes. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size.
</p>
<p>
    There is a basic equation in electrical engineering that states how the three terms relate. It says that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance or I = V/R. This is known as Ohm's law.
</p>
<p>
    Let's see how this relation applies to the plumbing system. Let's say you have a tank of pressurized water connected to a hose that you are using to water the garden.
</p>
<p>
    What happens if you increase the pressure in the tank? You probably can guess that this makes more water come out of the hose. The same is true of an electrical system: Increasing the voltage will make more current flow.
</p>
<p>
    Let's say you increase the diameter of the hose and all the fittings to the tank. You probably guessed that this also makes more water come out of the hose. This is like decreasing the resistance in an electrical system, which increases the current flow.
</p>
<p>
    Electrical power is measured in (watts W). In an electrical system power (P) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current (V*A=P).
</p>
<p>
    The water analogy still applies. Take a hose and point it at a waterwheel like the ones that were used to turn grinding stones in watermills. You can increase the power generated by the waterwheel in two ways. If you increase the pressure of the water coming out of the hose, it hits the waterwheel with a lot more force and the wheel turns faster, generating more power. If you increase the flow rate, the waterwheel turns faster because of the weight of the extra water hitting it.
